# Perfectly Matched Layers

To model unbounded domains, a popular technique is the application of so-called *perfectly matched layers* (PMLs). The idea here is to surround the domain of interest by an artificial damping layer, in a way that no reflections are induced. The then exponentially damped solutions are truncated at a finite width. This method works for frequency-domain, as well as time-domain problems.
