This jupyter-book serves as lecture notes for the lecture [Numerical methods for wave-type equations](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?courseNr=101A20&semester=2024S) held by [Markus Wess](mailto:markus.wess@tuwien.ac.at) at the [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.ac.at), [Institute of Analysis and Scientific Computing](https://asc.tuwien.ac.at) in SS2024.

It covers the theoretical, as well as the practical part of the lecture. As this is the first time this lecture is held, the notes will be updated and enhanced regularly to progress with the lecture.

The practical part uses the open source library [Netgen/NGSolve](https://www.ngsolve.org), basics will be covered throughout the lecture.
